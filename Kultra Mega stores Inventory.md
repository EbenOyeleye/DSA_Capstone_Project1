# Kultra Mega Stores Inventory
#### Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria.
#### I have been engaged as a Business Intelligence Analyst to support the Abuja division of KMS. The Business Manager has shared an Excel file containing order data from 2009 to 2012 and has requested that I analyze the data and present my key insights and findings. 
I am to apply my SQL skills from the DSA Data Analysis class and solve both case scenarios as shared in the document.
The following queries were used to cleanup the imported Excel data
``` SQL
alter table [KMS Sql Case Study] alter column profit decimal(18,2) 
alter table [KMS Sql Case Study] alter column unit_price decimal(18,2)
alter table [KMS Sql Case Study] alter column Discount decimal(18,2)
alter table [KMS Sql Case Study] alter column sales decimal(18,2)
alter table [KMS Sql Case Study] alter column Product_Base_Margin decimal(18,2)
alter table [KMS Sql Case Study] alter column Shipping_Cost decimal(18,2)

update [KMS Sql Case Study] set profit = 0 where profit is null
update [KMS Sql Case Study] set unit_price = 0  where unit_price is null
